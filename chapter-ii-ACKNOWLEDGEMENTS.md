# Acknowledgements and dedications

Special thanks to Tom Terado, Luke Schoen for helping edit the earlier drafts of this essay.

Appreciations to the very busy Martin Hellman for his editing, comments and additions to section one, revealing a patterned field of inaccuracies, resulting in a thorough review of my sources.

Thanks for David Chaum for his brief interactions during my time in writing chapter two.
